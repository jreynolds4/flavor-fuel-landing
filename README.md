**Smarter Meal Planning, Powered by AI**

Welcome to the temporary landing page for **FlavorFuel**, an AI-powered health and fitness meal planning platform designed to help you eat better, feel stronger, and stay consistent.

## 🚀 About FlavorFuel

Originally launched in 2019, FlavorFuel was built to solve a common problem: **how to eat well without the overwhelm**. Whether your goal is fat loss, muscle gain, or simply eating cleaner, our platform used AI to generate personalized meal plans based on your dietary needs and fitness goals.

Between December 2019 and April 2020:

- ✅ Built using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB
- ✅ Featured over 40+ dynamic components and integrations
- ✅ Successfully processed 50+ payments via Stripe
- ✅ Paused operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic

We’re now preparing for a **major relaunch** with an even stronger foundation, and you’re here at the beginning of that journey. 🙌
